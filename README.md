# ATM Management System

#	Introduction
An Automated teller Machine (ATM) is a computerized telecommunication device that provides the clients of a financial institution with access to financial transaction in a public space without the need for a cashier or bank teller. On most modern ATMs, the customer is identified by inserting a plastic ATM Card with magnetic stripe or a plastic smart card with a chip, that contains a unique card number and some security information such as an expiry date. Authentication is provided by the customer entering a personal Identification number (PIN).

#	Purpose
Using an ATM, customer can access their bank accounts in order to make cash withdrawals, transferring money to another bank account, check their account balances etc. ATM made our lives easier because, we don’t go to banks if we need money urgently if we have money in our bank account. It provides us portability of money because any time anywhere we can withdraw money from ATM.
